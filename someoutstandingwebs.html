        <a href="https://www.modden.co/" class="link" target="_blank">Visit Website</a>
        <p> Out of all selected websites, Modden has to be one of the most unique ones. We can appreciate interactive functions that mainly consist on animations whenever the mouse is on top of an element of the website. The most characteristic animation is that whenever you have your mouse on the look button,
            in this scenario the whole website falls. As mentioned before, it has several functionalities that really make this site come to life and feel like a real experience to the user. Additionally, it can also
            serve as fun way to keep them engaged with discovering everything they can do.
